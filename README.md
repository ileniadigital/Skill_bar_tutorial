# Skills bar tutorial
Here are the source files for the skills bar tutorial on my Instagram and Tik Tok.
Feel free to copy the code and use it on your website: do tag me on Instagram at @ilenia.digital if you use my code!
Make sure that if you rename your stylesheet, classes or ids, to match the names in both files.

For easy developing to check styling, use the Live Server extension on VS code: I find it very useful as it updates automatically every time you save, rather than having to refresh the page every time.

The original code is from W3Schools, while this is my version.
